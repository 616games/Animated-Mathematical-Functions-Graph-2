# Animated-Mathematical-Functions-Graph-2
Introduces Z as a second (non-time related) input to our functions to move them from an animated 2D line to an animated 3D grid of points.

To create the 3D grid, we square our resolution variable so we have as many lines along the Z axis as we have points along the X axis.
